# AI-ML-Engineering-Internship-Module_2_at-DevelopersHub-Corporation

This repository contains solutions to three advanced machine learning tasks completed during the AI/ML Engineering internship at Codeway. The projects demonstrate skills in multimodal learning, NLP with transformers, and building end-to-end ML pipelines.

## Task 1: Multimodal ML Housing Price Prediction Using Images + Tabular Data
**Objective:** Predict house prices using both structured data and images.

**Methodology:** Used a pre-trained VGG16 CNN for image feature extraction and combined these features with tabular data via a concatenation layer.

**Result:** Successfully trained a multimodal model, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of $267,571 on test data.

## Task 2: News Topic Classification Using BERT
**Objective:** Classify news articles into topics.

**Methodology:** Fine-tuned a BERT model, a state-of-the-art transformer, on a labeled news dataset for text classification.

**Result:** The model demonstrated high accuracy in categorizing news articles by topic.

## Task 3: End-to-End ML Pipeline with Scikit-learn Pipeline API
**Objective:** Build a robust, automated ML pipeline.

**Methodology:** Implemented scikit-learn's Pipeline and ColumnTransformer APIs to automate data preprocessing and model training, ensuring a clean and production-ready workflow.

**Result:** Created a scalable and efficient pipeline for a classification task, showcasing best practices in ML engineering.
